AVAILABLE CASES AND FILES
-------------------------

Case 1:
FILE: V4/EX1-camera/step1-FULL.lp
(Alternatively, combine:
  * V4/EX0-general/theory-3.lp
  * V4/EX0-general/step1.lp
  * V4/EX1-camera/output.lp
)
DESCRIPTION
% The SAM and camera are configured to use encrypted 
% memory and secure boot. 
% The basic camera is used.
% The SAM sets the camera to record at 25 fps.
%
% Questions:
%   1. Is the functionality concern satisfied?
%   2. Is the functional aspect satisfied?
%   3. Are all aspects satisfied?
%
% Output: empty table, meaning yes to all

Case 1 ALTERNATE:
FILE: V4/EX1-camera/step1-FULL-satisfied.lp
(Alternatively, combine:
  * V4/EX0-general/theory-3.lp
  * V4/EX0-general/step1.lp
  * V4/EX1-camera/output.lp
)
DESCRIPTION
% The SAM and camera are configured to use encrypted 
% memory and secure boot. 
% The basic camera is used.
% The SAM sets the camera to record at 25 fps.
%
% Questions:
%   1. Which properties, concerns and aspects are satisfied?
%
% Output: complete list, meaning all of them are satisfied


Case 2:
FILE: V4/EX1-camera/step2-FULL.lp
(Alternatively, combine:
* All files from Step 1
* V4/EX0-general/step2.lp
)
DESCRIPTION
% In the same configuration of Case 1,
% a cyberattack occurs and hacks the SAM to switch 
% the camera to recording at 50 fps.
%
% Questions:
%   1. Which properties, concerns, aspects are not satisfied?
%   2. What events are triggered?
%
% Answers:
%   1. - Functionality is violated if the basic camera
%        is recording at 50 fps with encrypted memory enabled
%      - The functional aspect is not satisfied because functionality 
%        is violated
%      - The full concern tree is not satisfied because the functional
%        aspect is violated
%   2. The recording is thrown out of court (because functional aspect
%      is violated)
%
% Output: + list of violated properties, concerns, aspects
%         + list of events triggered
%         Note: the last column indicates the time step in the evolution
%               of the example. Of interest is the LAST step.


Case 3:
FILE: V4/EX1-camera/step3-FULL.lp
(Alternatively, combine:
  * All files from Step 2
  * V4/EX0-general/step3.lp
)
DESCRIPTION
% We use the same configuration of Case 2.
% The attack affects the SAM and its effect cannot be directly reversed 
% in order to lower the recording rate of the camera.
% We want to know if there is a mitigation and, if so, which one.
%
% Questions:
%   1. What is the mitigation, if there is one?
%   2. Which properties, concerns, aspects are not satisfied?
%   3. What events are triggered?
%
% Answers:
%   1. The mitigation is to replace the basic camera with 
%      the advanced one
%   2. All properties, concerns, aspects are satisfied
%   3. No events are triggered. The recording is no longer thrown 
%      out of court
%
% Output: + list of violated properties, concerns, aspects
%         + list of events triggered
%         + mitigation actions
%         Note: the last column indicates the time step in the evolution
%               of the example. Of interest is the LAST step.


Case 3 (Extended):
FILE: EX1-camera/step3-ext-FULL.lp
(Alternatively, combine:
  * All files from Step 3
  * EX0-general/step3-ext.lp
)
DESCRIPTION
% In the same configuration of Case 1,
% a cyberattack occurs and hacks the SAM to switch 
% the camera to recording at 50 fps.
% The attack affects the SAM and its effect cannot 
% be reversed unless a patch is applied to the SAM. The patch
% forces the SAM to switch the camera to 25 fps.
%
% Questions:
%   1. What are the mitigations, if there are any?
%   2. Which properties, concerns, aspects are not satisfied?
%   3. What events are triggered?
%
% Answers:
%   1. - One mitigation is to replace the basic camera with 
%        the advanced one
%      - Another mitigation is to patch the SAM
%   2. All properties, concerns, aspects are satisfied with both
%      mitigations
%   3. No events are triggered. The recording is no longer thrown 
%      out of court
%
% Output: two separate outputs, one for each mitigation, including:
%         + the list of violated properties, concerns, aspects
%         + list of events triggered
%         + mitigation actions
%         Note: the last column indicates the time step in the evolution
%               of the example. Of interest is the LAST step.
