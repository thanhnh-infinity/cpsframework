# xsd2owl
A tool for generating OWL from XSD and XML.

# Introduction
This tool is used in Mudrod to generate an OWL manifestation of the 
[Directory Interchange Format (DIF) Standard](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/standards/directory-interchange-format-dif-standard), 
a specific set of attributes for describing Earth science data. 
From its conception in the late 1980â€™s as a way to document and exchange information on scientific data 
to its implementation in the Global Change Master Directory (GCMD), the DIF has evolved to serve the 
user community in the discovery, access and use of Earth science and related data.

# Requirements
 * Java8
 
# Installation
You must first install [Ontmalizer](https://github.com/srdc/ontmalizer.git) as it is not yet available in Maven Central.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/srdc/ontmalizer.git && cd ontmalizer
$ mvn clean install
```
You can then install xsd2owl as follows
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mudrod/xsd2owl.git && cd xsd2owl
$ mvn clean install
```

# Usage

The tool does not need to be invoked with any input parameters. By default it will
look on the classpath for the [dif_v10.2.xsd](https://github.com/mudrod/xsd2owl/blob/master/src/main/resources/dif_v10.2.xsd)
file which is the XSD manifestation of the DIF as mentioned above.

If however you wish to use a different file, you should invoke the tool with the parameter as below

```
$ java -jar target/xsd2owl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h
usage: Mapper
    --inputFile <file>   A path to a local XSD file.
```
